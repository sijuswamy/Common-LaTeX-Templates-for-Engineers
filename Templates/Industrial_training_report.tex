\section{Introduction}
The purpose of Industrial Training is to expose students to real work of environment
experience and at the same time, to gain the knowledge through hands on observation and
job execution. From the industrial training, the students will also develop skills in work ethics,
communication, management and others. Moreover, this practical training program allows
students to relate theoretical knowledge with its application in the manufacturing industry.
The objectives of industrial training are:

When you pursue a technical course like BCA, MCA, B.Tech, and M.Tech, you have to go through live project training in different semesters in which you have to submit minor and major projects through which Universities get to know that a particular student or candidate has completed this training and his degree.

Universities come to know that students have both theoretical and practical knowledge about their subjects. Through practical training, students also get industrial experience through industrial training. Candidates and students also come to know about how to work in the industry.

A university teaches students, giving practical knowledge of the industry, and making the students eligible for the job in the same field. A student will become qualified for the job when he works in the real environment of the industry. That’s why industrial training is compulsory under all technical courses like B.Tech, M.Teh, BCA, and MCA.

Engineering students have to do this industrial training under any technology of any company or industry under the supervisor of the company. It is not only compulsory for the students of Computer science, but also mechanical engineering students, civil engineering students, and other engineering courses. Industrial training has been made mandatory for students who are pursuing technical courses.

\section{Benefits Of Industrial Training}
We all have faced one common problem which is practical knowledge. Most of the freshers are unable to getting desire jobs due to lack of practical and live experience.

Companies only want you to work productively for them, which you can only do with the help of industrial training. So, for gaining practical knowledge, industrial training is critical.

\section{How is Industrial Training important for Computer Science Students?}
Industrial training is especially essential for students of computer science. Computer science students have a lot to do with different technologies like .Net, PHP, Web designing, digital marketing, android application development, and many more.

After every six months, new technology gets introduced in the market. So, industrial training for students of computer science is crucial. If you are a student of computer science and think that you do not need industrial training and you will stay at home and enjoy holidays at the time of industrial training, then you are wrong.
